# Simon Game :game_die:

Welcome to Simon Game, an electronic memory game that challenges your ability to recall and reproduce sequences of light and sound. This game features four colored buttons, each with a corresponding tone, that light up in a particular sequence which you must then repeat in the same order. The game starts with a simple sequence but gets progressively more difficult as you advance through levels.

## How to Play :video_game:

1. Press any key to begin the game.
2. Watch and listen carefully as Simon produces a sequence of tones and lights up the corresponding buttons.
3. Repeat the sequence by pressing the buttons in the same order.
4. If you successfully reproduce the sequence, you will advance to the next level with a longer and more complex sequence.
5. If you make a mistake, the game will end and you will have to start again from the beginning.
